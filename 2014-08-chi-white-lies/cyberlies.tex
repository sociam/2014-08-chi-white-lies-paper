\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience.  Please read
previous years' Proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used.  It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., what is the unique contribution that your work
makes to the field?  Please consider what the reader will learn from
your submission, and how they will find your work useful.  If you
write with these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be
successful, both in being accepted into the Conference, and in
influencing the work of our field.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
